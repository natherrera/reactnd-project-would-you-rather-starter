# Would You Rather Project from Udacity's React Nanodegree

This is the code for the second assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

"Would You Rather" is an application that allows users to play by choosing the options they would prefer over different situations created by other users, and also create their own "Would You Rather". The technologies applied here will demonstrate the knowledge acquired during the first unit of the course.

## How to use

To get started deploying the project right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
